# 📜 Description

Before being acquired and closed by Google in 2018, Lytro was an company developing [plenoptic cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Light_field_camera) for the general public.

The main use of light-field camera is the ability to change image focus during post-processing and thus, for example, being able to remove any blur or to create animated GIF with just one button pressed on the DSLR.
